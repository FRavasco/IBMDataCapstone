# IBMDataCapstone

### Capstone project developed to achieve the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. 
### The ultimate goal of this capstone was to predict if Space X :rocket:, Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. 

SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 :rocket: launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

This capstone project involved:

- Gathering data from different sources:
  - With an API
  - From webscrapping with ***Beautifull Soup***
  - From SQL database
- Loading data into ***Pandas*** dataframes
- Data wrangling
- Exploratory Data Analysis with ***Pandas*** and ***Matplotlib***
- Building a dashboard with ***Plotly Dash***
- Building an interactive map with ***Folium*** to analyse the launch sites proximity
- Predictive analysis with SVM, Classification Trees, and Logistic Regression, 
- Finding the best method using the data available.
